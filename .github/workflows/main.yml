# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Print branch name
    - name: Branch name
      run: echo running on branch ${github.ref}

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Semantic Release
      id: semantic-release   # Need an `id` for output variables
      uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
      with:
        dry-run: ${github.ref == "refs/head/master"}
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
            
    - name: Do something if a new release published
      if: steps.semantic.outputs.new_release_published == 'true'
      run: |
        echo 'Released a new version to npm'
